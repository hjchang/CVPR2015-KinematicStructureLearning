This directory contains a set of codes for kinematic structure learning develeped at the Personal Robotics Laboratory in Imperial College London, UK. This module is mainly developed in Matlab with OpenCV. 

## Requirements

In order to run the module properly, it is required to install the followings:
- Matlab
- OpenCV 2.3.x
- YARP

Then, the OpenCV and YARP should be connected to Matlab.

1. Matlab + OpenCV
You can use 'mexopencv' for this. 
Here is a well-described manual for the mexopencv setting:
http://vision.is.tohoku.ac.jp/~kyamagu/software/mexopencv/

2. Matlab + YARP
Here are instructions for calling YARP from Matlab:
http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Calling_yarp_from_Matlab

## How to run the module

1. Loading input data from 'Cam/Video/Images'

	a) Run the 'main_solely.m' code
	
	b) Select a input source by the number. (Note: The '2:Yarp' is not working)
	
	c) Select a video or a folder of images.

2. Loading input data from 'YARP/ABM'

	a) Run the ABM server
	
	b) Check the yarp namespace for ABM

	c) Run the 'main_YARP_trigger.m' code
	
	d) $ yarp rpc /matlab/kinematicStructure/rpc
	
	e) $ startStructureLearning #num_instance [left or right camera] [first frame] [last frame]
	
	f) Closeing module: $ quit 

## Abstract

In this paper we present a novel framework for unsupervised kinematic structure learning of complex articulated objects from a single-view image sequence. In contrast to prior motion information based methods, which estimate relatively simple articulations, our method can generate arbitrarily complex kinematic structures with skeletal topology by a successive iterative merge process. The iterative merge process is guided by a skeleton distance function which is generated from a novel object boundary generation method from sparse points. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows: (i) Unsupervised complex articulated kinematic structure learning by combining motion and skeleton information. (ii) Iterative fine-to-coarse merging strategy for adaptive motion segmentation and structure smoothing. (iii) Skeleton estimation from sparse feature points. (iv) A new highly articulated object dataset containing multi-stage complexity with ground truth. Our experiments show that the proposed method out-performs state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
